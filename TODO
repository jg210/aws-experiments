* resource "aws_lambda_function" "spring_experiments" is always updated
  - source_code_hash changing
  - source_code_hash needs to be "Base64-encoded SHA256 hash of the package file"
  - etag isn't suitable
  - might have to compute fingerprint outside terraform and pass in somehow?

* Alternatives to requirements.txt and constraints.txt
  - they don't remove packages that aren't listed
  - alternatives?
    - pip lock?
    - pipenv?
    - poetry?
    - ???

* The spring-experiments jar could be made more streamlined.
  - doesn't need to support HTTP server since only deploy with lambda
  - faster startup by e.g. removing bean discovery.

* Move commands from README.md to ~/bin/setup

* Try out terraform registry modules for lambda functions etc.
  - https://registry.terraform.io/modules/howdio/lambda/aws/0.2.1
  - https://registry.terraform.io/modules/techjacker/lambda-api-gateway/aws/1.0.2

* http to https redirection for API gateway.
  - would need cloudfront?
    - https://stackoverflow.com/a/47373353

* Automated staged deployment.

* Automated tests.
  - https://www.terraform.io/docs/github-actions/getting-started/index.html?
  - terraform graph step commented out since terraform S3 backend needs AWS credentials
    - this might allow multiple backends?
      - https://www.monterail.com/blog/chicken-or-egg-terraforms-remote-backend
  - store terraform dependency-graph svg and link to it from README.md.

* "terraform plan" still outputs terminal control sequences if pipe stdout to less.

* pip shell completion

* Cache docker images on CI.

* AWS X-Ray tracing?
  - need to instrument app?
    - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/xray/latest/devguide/xray-sdk-java.html

* KMS encryption of state?
  - CKV_AWS_145 - terraform state
  - CKV_AWS_158 - lambda and API gateway logs
